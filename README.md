# Who Should Read This?

Before joining the project you should read this if you are in these groups:

- **Frontend Developers**
- **Backend Developers**
- **Full-stack Developers**
- **DevOps Engineers**
- **QA Engineers**
- **Project Managers/Leads**

This documentation serves as a roadmap for smooth collaboration, high-quality work, and efficient progress for all members of the team.

# Motivation

Our software development practices are based on principles of [Continuous Delivery](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/continuous-delivery/), as highlighted in the DORA research ([DORA Research Program](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/dora_research_program.pdf)) and advocated in the book [Accelerate](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339). 

DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA), a six-year research program, along with the insights from the book "Accelerate", have shed light on the practices that high-performing software teams adopt. Here are the key findings condensed into a more readable form:

- ðŸ’¼ **Small Batch Sizes & Frequent Code Deployments**: High-performing teams often deliver work in small batches and deploy code frequently.

- ðŸŒ³ **Trunk-Based Development**: High performers consistently employ this practice, leading to better overall performance.

- ðŸ”„ **Continuous Delivery Impact**: Teams practicing Continuous Delivery, including comprehensive configuration management, automated testing, and deployment, experience lower change failure rates and faster recovery times.

- ðŸ‘¥ **Culture & Collaboration**: A culture promoting information sharing, trust, and collaboration correlates with better software delivery performance and reduced burnout.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance & Competitive Advantage**: Effective software delivery and operational practices can drive profitability, productivity, customer satisfaction, and overall competitive advantage.

These insights guide our team's development practices, striving for continuous improvement and high performance.

## Github Rules

The purpose of these guidelines is to create a clean, streamlined, and efficient process for collaboration to build and deliver quality software. 

### Branching

We follow a [Trunk Based Development](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-trunk-based-development) model, which is a critical practice in Continuous Delivery and entails:

- All developers work on a single branch named `main`.
- New features, bug fixes, or any other changes are made in short-lived feature branches which are branched off of `main`.
- These feature branches should be merged back into `main` as soon as possible to avoid long-lived branches that may cause merge conflicts and diverging code bases.

### Pull Requests (PRs)

- The number of open PRs should be kept small to ensure prompt review and feedback.
- A PR should be related to only one feature or bugfix. This makes it easier to review and understand the changes.
- Code reviews are mandatory. Each PR must be reviewed by at least one other developer before it can be merged.
- Please ensure to write a clear and concise PR description explaining the changes and the reason for them.

### Naming Conventions

- Branch names should be concise, descriptive and reflect the task at hand, e.g., `feat/login-system`, `fix/password-reset`.
- If (and usually this is the case) the branch is related to a Jira ticket, in that case the branch name should reflect the ticket ID, e.g. `BC-177`

## Continuous Delivery

In line with the practices of Continuous Delivery, any code that is merged into the `main` branch should be deployable. Our team ensures that deployment to production happens automatically whenever code is merged into `main`. 

To ensure the reliability and stability of the `main` branch, we have a set of CI/CD pipeline checks that must be passed before any code can be merged. These checks are implemented as GitHub Actions and include:

- Unit & Feature Tests: These ensure that the individual units of your code and their interactions are working as expected.
- Static Analysis (Larastan): Larastan is used to perform static analysis of the PHP code to detect errors without actually running the code.
- E2E Tests: If any end-to-end tests exist, they must be passed to ensure the system works together as a whole.
- TSLint Check: TSLint is used to ensure that the frontend TypeScript code adheres to a consistent style and does not contain any errors or issues.

## How to verify on staging?

Given our single "main" branch approach, staging deployments are handled slightly differently to ensure that our main branch remains deployable at any time. 

Here's the typical workflow for deploying to the staging environment:

1. **Local Development**: Work on your feature or bug fix on your local machine, adhering to the guidelines mentioned in the Github Rules section. 

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Once you've tested your changes locally, push your changes to a remote branch on GitHub and create a pull request to the `main` branch. Ensure that you have added the relevant unit tests and they are passing. 

3. **Code Review & Continuous Integration**: The pull request triggers our continuous integration pipeline, which includes unit & feature tests, static analysis, E2E tests (if present), and TSLint check on FE. The code is also reviewed by your peers during this time.

4. **Deploy to Staging**: After your pull request has been approved and all CI checks have passed, you may deploy your changes to the staging environment. For example, if you're working on branch BC-177, you can go to Envoyer, find the staging application, run deploy and choose your branch. For the frontend, you should either have a Netlify deploy preview or go to your app in Netlify and deploy it from your branch on staging. 

    This deployment strategy means that only one branch can be deployed to a staging environment at a time. To facilitate simultaneous testing by multiple teams, each team should have its own dedicated staging environment if they are all working on the same project.

5. **Staging Verification**: Once your changes have been deployed to staging, perform your validation and regression tests to ensure that everything works as expected. 

6. **Merge to Main**: After successful validation in the staging environment, merge your pull request to the `main` branch. The merge triggers the automated deployment to the production environment.

By following these steps, we can ensure that our staging environment is used for testing and validation, and the `main` branch always reflects a stable state of the application ready for production.

## Getting Started

After cloning the project, follow the below steps to setup the environment:

### 1. Backend Setup:

Assuming you have composer and PHP installed in your environment, navigate to the project's directory and run:

```bash
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```
Make sure to setup the correct DB connections and other required .env parameters.

Then run the migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```
And finally, start the server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

### 2. Frontend Setup:

Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed, navigate to the project's directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, compile and hot-reload for development:

```bash
npm run serve
```
